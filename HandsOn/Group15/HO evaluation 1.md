    Analysis
        - The analysis.html file does not contain the license of the dataset to be generated.
        - The resource naming strategy is wrong. Classes and properties must both use hash. There are two options for individuals and one is not correct.
    Ontology
    RDF generated
        - The RDF file does not follow the resource naming strategy.
        - locatedDistrict is used as a datatype property and as an object property.
        - All the addresses are put together in the same street (it is not the same a street than an address).
