    Ontology
        - In OWL, having multiple domains (or ranges) means that the domain (or range) is the intersection of all the classes.  The current definitions of properties with multiple domains are wrong.
        - The ontology does not contain object properties to relate the different classes.
        - Not all the ranges in the ontology are strings.
    RDF generated
        - Strange characters are included in values.
        - There are encoding problems in strings.
        - Datatypes are missing.
        - The values for Bici are not correct.
