    Ontology
        - Multiple domains are defined for hasType.
        - In OWL, having multiple domains (or ranges) means that the domain (or range) is the intersection of all the classes.  The current definitions of properties with multiple domains are wrong.
    RDF generated
        - Empty values are inserted.
        - Some types in the data should reflect types in the class hierarchy in the ontology and should not be encoded as property values.
