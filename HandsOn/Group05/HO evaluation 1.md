    Analysis
        - The resource naming strategy does not include a path for the ontology terms.
        - The resource naming strategy is not defined for individuals.
    Ontology
        - xsd:char does not exist.
        - Accents can be included in labels.
    RDF generated
        - Values are defined as URIs.
        - The RDF file does not follow the resource naming strategy.
        - Add labels to individuals; don't require people to interpret your URIs.
        - Datatypes are missing.
        - It could happen that two individuals from different classes have the same URI because the naming strategy does not ensure uniqueness.
